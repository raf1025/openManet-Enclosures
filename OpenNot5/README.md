# Open Not 5 Node Enclosure

## Overview
This enclosure is designed for OpenMANET field nodes and integrates a Pi 4B with an internal battery-backed UPS.  
The aluminum chassis doubles as a passive heatsink and keeps all IO accessible through waterproof bulkhead ports. This also can be 3D printed but may get hot.
